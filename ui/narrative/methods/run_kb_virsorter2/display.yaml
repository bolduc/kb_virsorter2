        short-hint: |

        long-hint: |

        ui-name: |
            Require hallmark genes on ALL sequences
        short-hint: |

        long-hint: |
            Require hallmark gene on all sequences to give a conservative set of high confidence viral contigs. All predicted sequences will contain one or more hallmark genes.

    require_short_hallmarks:
        ui-name: |
            Require hallmark genes on short (RNA <5K; DNA <3K) sequences. May reduce false positives
        short-hint: |
            Require hallmark genes on short sequences. RNA virus < 5K and other viral groups < 3K are considered short; Reduce false positive with some sensitivity loss
        long-hint: |
            Require hallmark genes on short sequences. RNA virus < 5K and other viral groups < 3K are considered short; This can reduce false positive at reasonable cost of sensitivity

    max_orfs:
        ui-name: |
            Max orfs used in calculating taxonomic features. Reduces computation. -1 disables (only provirus-off)
        short-hint: |
            Max number of orfs used to calculate taxonomic features. If exceeded, it is sub-sampled to reduce computation. -1 disables. Must be used with disable_provirus.
        long-hint: |
            Maximum number of orfs used for calculating taxonomic features. If the number of ords in a sequence exceeds this limit, it is sub-sampled to this number to reduce computation. To disable, set to -1; this option must be used together with disable_provirus option.

    viral_gene_required:
        ui-name: |
            Require viral genes to be annotated. Can reduce false positives
        short-hint: |
            Require that viral genes to be annotated. Will remove putative viral sequences without annotation
        long-hint: |
            Require that viral genes to be annotated. Will remove putative viral sequences without annotation. This can reduce false positives at reasonable cost to sensitivity

    viral_gene_enrichment:
        ui-name: |
            Disable requiring more viral genes than cellular to call full sequence viral
        short-hint: |
            Disable requiring more viral than cellular genes for calling full sequence viral. Useful for DRAM-v output when other tools identified viral sequences
        long-hint: |
            Disable requiring more viral than cellular genes for calling full sequence viral. This is useful when only using VirSorter2 to produce DRAMv input with viral sequence identified from other tools, or those trimmed by checkV

    disable_provirus:
        ui-name: |
            Disable provirus extraction after classifying full contigs
        short-hint: |
            By default, provirus regions are extracted after classifying full contig sequences. This will disable it.
        long-hint: |
            By default, provirus regions are extracted after classifying full contig sequences. This will disable it. Together with lower max_orfs, can significantly speed up a run.

description : |
    <p>VirSorter2 is a DNA and RNA virus identification tool that leverages genome-informed database advances across
    a collection of customized automatic classifiers to improve the accuracy and range of virus sequence detection.
    When benchmarked against genomes from both isolated and uncultivated viruses, VirSorter2 uniquely performed
    consistently with high accuracy (F1-score > 0.8) across viral diversity, while all other tools under-detected
    viruses outside of the group most represented in reference databases (i.e., those in the order Caudovirales).
    Among the tools evaluated, VirSorter2 was also uniquely able to minimize errors associated with atypical cellular
    sequences including eukaryotic genomes and plasmids. Finally, as the virosphere exploration unravels novel viral
    sequences, VirSorter2's modular design makes it inherently able to expand to new types of viruses via the design
    of new classifiers to maintain maximal sensitivity and specificity.A more thorough description of this tool (and
    the code it runs) is available at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/MAVERICLab/virsorter2">VirSorter2</a>.

    Briefly, this App will consume viral genomes (in several KBase object formats) and generate predicted viral
    sequences (KBase.Assembly).
